# Data model CLERUS

The development of the data model for CLERUS has been a dynamic process. Initially we applied a top down approach in which we defined all the various field that we would want it to exist. However in the process of the datacollection it appeared that the various datasets which are integrated for CLERUS did not contain the requested information.

The schematic overview of the datamodel that has been created can be accessed [here](https://viewer.diagrams.net/?tags=%7B%7D&highlight=0000ff&edit=_blank&layers=1&nav=1&title=CLERUS_design.drawio#Uhttps%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FMorrizzzzz%2FDigiDuRe%2Fmain%2F1_Data_Harmonization%2FCLERUS_design.drawio). The various tables the datamodel exists of are described below.

The database exists of seven tables. At the core of the database the table **01_clerus_bio** is put with the basic biographical information about an individual. it contains for instanc the name, surname, year of birth, year of death etc. for every person. The information from  **01_clerus_bio** is rather generic and is in theory not bound ministers only. Making a distinction between generic data and more contextual data is a deliberate decision in the design of the datamodel.

## 01_clerus_bio

A SQL code to create **01_clerus_bio** is provided below.

```sql

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS "01_clerus_bio";

CREATE TABLE "01_clerus_bio" (
  "clerus_id" INTEGER,                              --Unique identifyer and primary key in the database
  "first_name" TEXT,                                --First name

  "birth_place" TEXT,                               --place of birth
  "birth_place_id" INTEGER DEFAULT 0,               --this field contains an autogenerated primary key to allow adding alternative spellings for the placename which is stored in 21_birth_alt_place
  "birth_year" INTEGER,                             --year of birth
  "birth_date_exact" INTEGER DEFAULT 0,             --exact date of birth ddmmyyyy
  "birth_year_accuracy" VARCHAR(255),               --comments about the accuracy of the birth date e.g. circa , ca. etc.
  "baptism_place" VARCHAR(255),                     --place of baptism
  "baptism_place_id" INTEGER DEFAULT 0,             --this field contains an autogenerated primary key to allow adding alternative spellings for the placename which is stored in 22_baptism_alt_place
  "baptism_year" INTEGER,                           --year in which the baptism took place
  "baptism_date_exact" INTEGER DEFAULT 0,           --exact date of the baptism
  "baptism_date_accuracy" VARCHAR(255),             --comments about the accuracy of the baptism date e.g. circa , ca. etc.
  "death_place" VARCHAR(255),                       --place of death
  "death_place_id" INTEGER DEFAULT 0,               --this field contains an autogenerated primary key to allow adding alternative spellings for the placename which is stored in 23_death_alt_place
  "death_year" INTEGER,                             --year of death
  "death_date_exact" INTEGER DEFAULT 0,             --exact date of death
  "death_date_accuracy" VARCHAR(255),               --comments about the accuracy of the death date e.g. circa , ca. etc.
  "burried_place" VARCHAR(255),                     --place where someone is burried
  "burried_place_id" INTEGER DEFAULT 0,             --this field contains an autogenerated primary key to allow adding alternative spellings for the placename which is stored in 24_burried_alt_place
  "funeral_year" INTEGER DEFAULT 0,                 --year of funeral
  "funeral_date_exact" INTEGER DEFAULT 0,           --exact date of funeral
  "funeral_data_accuracy" VARCHAR(255),             --comments about the accuracy of the funeral date e.g. circa , ca. etc.
  "remarks" TEXT,                                   --remarks about the individual
  "remarks_source" TEXT,                            --remarks about the source (e.g. a reference to a source)
);
```
## 02_drc_org

As a one-to-one relationship with **01_clerus_bio** the table **02_drc_org** is installed. This table contains the original input form the [DRC text file](1_1_DRC_1555-1816.ipynb). The reason to not integrate this into **01_clerus_bio** is because the database design strategy is to make a distinction between generic and more contextual data. Furthermore, the final version of CLERUS will not contain this information for every individual, since it will also contain information from for instance [DM](1_2_DM_1572-2004.ipynb).

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS "02_drc_org";

CREATE TABLE "02_drc_org" (
  "drc_id" INTEGER,                                 --Key that corresponds with the clerus_id in 01_clerus_bio. Since DRC is used as basis for CLERUS we decided to use the same value for CLERUS as used in DRC. Therefore the drc_id can be directly connected with the clerus_id.   
  "original_input_drc" TEXT                         --The original input text string from DRC
);
```

## 03_clerus_exam

The table **03_clerus_exam** contains information about the exam of an individual and is considered to have a one-to-one (one row for every inidividual where information about the exam date is known) relationship with **01_clerus_bio**, since the exam for getting the "proponent"-status, which allows to act as minister needs to be done only once.

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS "03_clerus_exam";

CREATE TABLE "03_clerus_exam" (
  "clerus_id" VARCHAR(255),                         --Unique identifyer and primary key in the database
  "prep_exam_classis" VARCHAR(255),                 --The classis (administrative entity) where the preperation exam took place
  "prep_exam_date_exact" INTEGER DEFAULT 0,         --exact date of preperation exam ddmmyyyy
  "prep_exam_year" VARCHAR(255),                    --the year the preperation exam took place
  "prop_exam_classis" VARCHAR(255),                 --The classis (administrative entity) where the proponent exam took place
  "prop_exam_date_exact" INTEGER DEFAULT 0,         --the exact date of the exam to obtain the proponent status
  "prop_exam_date_year" INTEGER DEFAULT 0,          --year of the exam to obtain the proponent status
  "commendati_classis" VARCHAR(255),                --The classis (administrative entity) where the someone got the commendati status
  "commendati_classis_date_exact" INTEGER DEFAULT 0,--The exact date when someone got the commendati status
  "commendati_classis_year" INTEGER DEFAULT 0       --The year when someone got the commendati status
);
```

## 11_clerus_alt_name
Since individuals can have multiple alternative names, the table **11_clerus_alt_name** is considered a one to many relationship with **01_clerus_bio**.

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS "11_clerus_alt_name";

CREATE TABLE "11_clerus_alt_name" (           
  "clerus_id" INTEGER,                              --foreign key to 01_clerus_bio
  "alt_name" TEXT,                                  --alternative name in case it is not specified
  "alt_first_name" VARCHAR(255),                    --alternative first name  
  "alt_infix" VARCHAR(255),                         --alternative infix
  "alt_surname" VARCHAR(255),                       --alternative surname
  "alt_info_family" VARCHAR(255),                   --alternative information about the family
  "remarks_alt_name" TEXT,                          --remarks about the alternative name
  "alt_initials" VARCHAR(255)                       --alternative initials
);
```

## 12_clerus_role
The table **12_clerus_role** contains information about the various roles an individual could have had over time. Since an individual could have had multiple roles over time, **12_clerus_rols** has a one to many relationship with **01_clerus_bio**. The table also allows to add overlapping roles. 

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS "12_clerus_role";

CREATE TABLE "12_clerus_role" (
  "clerus_id" INTEGER,                              --foreign key to 01_clerus_bio
  "role_type" VARCHAR(255),                         --the type of role  
  "role_place" TEXT,                                --the placename of the role
  "role_place_id" TEXT,                             ---this field contains an autogenerated primary key to allow adding alternative spellings for the placename which is stored in 25_role_alt_place
  "role_classis_code" INTEGER DEFAULT 0,            --the classis code of the role
  "role_classis" VARCHAR(255),                      --the classis of the role
  "role_parish" VARCHAR(255),                       --the parish name of the role
  "role_province" VARCHAR(255),                     --the name of the province of the role
  "role_region" VARCHAR(255),                       --the name of the region of the rol
  "role_start_year" INTEGER,                        --start year of the role
  "role_start_date_exact" INTEGER DEFAULT 0,        --exact starting date of the role
  "role_start_year_accuracy" VARCHAR(255),          --comments about the accuracy of starting data of the role e.g. circa , ca. etc.
  "role_end_year" INTEGER DEFAULT 0,                --end year of the role
  "role_end_date_exact" INTEGER DEFAULT 0,          --exact end date of the role 
  "role_end_year_accuracy" VARCHAR(255),            --comments about the accuracy of starting data of the role e.g. circa , ca. etc.
  "role_residence_place" VARCHAR(255),              --place of residence for the role      
  "role_residence_place_id" INTEGER DEFAULT 0,      --this field contains an autogenerated primary key to allow adding alternative spellings for the placename which is stored in 26_residence_alt_place
  "role_remarks" TEXT                               --remarks about the role
);

```
## 2x_xxx_alt_place
Within the dataset there are multiple field that contain information about place names. To allow for multiple alternative spellings of placenames a series of tables are generated which are linked as one to many relationships with the various tables presented above. 

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS "21_birth_alt_place";
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS "22_baptism_alt_place";
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS "23_death_alt_place";
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS "24_burried_alt_place";
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS "25_role_alt_place";
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS "26_residence_alt_place";

CREATE TABLE "21_birth_alt_place" (
  "birth_place_id" INTEGER DEFAULT 0,             --foreign key for birth place
  "alt_place_name" VARCHAR(255)                   --alternative spelling for place name
);

CREATE TABLE "22_baptism_alt_place" (
  "baptized_place_id" INTEGER DEFAULT 0,          --foreign key for baptism place
  "alt_place_name" VARCHAR(255)                   --alternative spelling for place name
);

CREATE TABLE "23_death_alt_place" (
  "death_place_id" INTEGER DEFAULT 0,             --foreign key for death place
  "alt_place_name" VARCHAR(255)                   --alternative spelling for place name
);

CREATE TABLE "24_burried_alt_place" (
  "burried_place_id" INTEGER DEFAULT 0,           --foreign key for burried place
  "alt_place_name" VARCHAR(255)                   --alternative spelling for place name
);

CREATE TABLE "25_role_alt_place" (
  "role_place_id" INTEGER DEFAULT 0,              --foreign key for role place
  "alt_place_name" VARCHAR(255)                   --alternative spelling for place name
);

CREATE TABLE "26_residence_alt_place" (
  "role_place_residence_id" INTEGER DEFAULT 0,    --foreign key for residence place
  "alt_place_name" VARCHAR(255)                   --alternative spelling for place name
);
```

## 00_clerus_id_links
The CLERUS dataset is created by integrating various structured and semi-structured datasources. Since it underwent a roudn of curation it is unclear where the values for all the fields orginally came from. Also, some fields are presen in multiple tables. It has therefore been decided to not save all the links of every individual source, but instead create a table which contains all the unique values of the various datasets and stores which are linked to the same individual,in this case through a unique **clerus_id** value.

The table has a one to one relationship with **01_clerus_bio**. 

```sql
CREATE TABLE "00_clerus_id_links" (
  "clerus_id" INTEGER DEFAULT 0,          --clerus_id key
  "drc_id" INTEGER DEFAULT 0,             --key for drc 
  "NR_bz" VARCHAR(255),                   --key for boekzaalijst
  "keppel_id" VARCHAR(255),               --key for keppel dataset 
  "DM_id" VARCHAR(255),                   --key for Dutch Ministers dataset
  "ACTA_id" VARCHAR(255)                --key for ACTA dataset
);
```
