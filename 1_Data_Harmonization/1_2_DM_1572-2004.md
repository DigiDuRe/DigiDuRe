# Dutch Ministers (DM) 1572-2004

Besides dataset 1, presented above, an integration with another dataset, Dutch Ministers (DM) 1572-2004 (predikantenbestand ca1572-ca2004.accdb) containing information about the careers, needs to be made as well. The dataset that needs to be integrated has been created by one of Van Lieburg´s student assistants in the past and is said to **contain more up to date information** where individuals acted as ministers. The dataset contains the careers of the various ministers and tells where they have acted as “predikant” (minister). The data is stored as a separate table where every moment a new position as minister was taken have been stored in a separate row (figure 2). In case an individual had more positions as minister in its career this dataset contains multiple rows for that individual. For instance, Isaäc Abbema in the example had two posts one from 1618 to 1635 in Berkenwoude and from 1635 to 1637 in Gouda.

Contrary to Dataset 1/ DRC, this dataset also contains data about ministers that started their careers after 1815. For the DRC van Lieburg (the Lead Applicant of the project) wants to use this dataset as the starting point for the individual ministers. However, something that makes this dataset complicated to work with is that over time people had the same name and individuals are not easily distinguishable since no unique ID is provided. Yet, the Lead applicant is certaOut of the 53646 records this dataset contains, 25082 times exactly the same name is used. However, counting the number of times a name is used, where every count would be a step in its career, results in unfeasible career paths. J. de Jong would have had 30 positions over an unfeasible long period of time. Looking closely at the dataset “J. de Jong” appears to be a name that, not surprisingly in the Netherlands, represents multiple individuals.

As a strategy in this harmonization process we have decided to take the DRC as a starting point. To take DM as starting point is currently not feasible, since individuals are difficult to distinguish. However taking DRC as a starting point is also difficult since the locations where ministers were stationed seems to be not accurate. We have therefore made a join between locations that came out of the notebook above on the combination name, infix, surname, placename, year and counted the number of ministers where these where exactly the same. Next we compared the number of identical positions minister had in DRC and DM that exactly matched (thus where name, infix, surname, placename and year are identical). By comparing the counts of fields there are exactly the same with each other we are able to see if the individual ministers in DRC are complete. For those where the number of matching positions do not match a database is created that needs to be curated.

However before performing this harmonzation step, the DM needs to be cleaned. A thorough analysis scan of the dataset revealed a series of errors listed below. 
-	Information is stored in wrong column. 
-	Spaces in front of name (make it difficult to link)
-	; between name and surname is lacking, making it at a later stage difficult to split these
-	Many individuals have only one value in the field predikant, making it difficult to link these thus it is difficult to distinguish surname or name 

A round of corrections has been executed and produced an updated list. Furthermore, it contains 131 records that still needs to be checked. This however does not mean that the rest of the file does not contain any errors. This data cleaning only looked at the following issues:
-	whether “jaar intrede” has a numeric value
-	“predikant” does not start with a number
-	how many semicolons there are in field “predikant” (and if not 1 put in the list to check)
-	whether “predikant” starts with a space

With this cleaned dataset the datasets from DM and DRC are checked. The script that we developed for this can be accessed [here](/act1/db_check_id.ipynb)
