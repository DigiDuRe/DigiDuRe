# DigiDuRe
This repository contains codes and scripts developed for the Digital Dutch Religion Portal 1500-2000 project.

The project aims to map long-term developments in Dutch public discourse, especially in religion. It will link the national bibliography (STCN, GGC) over five centuries to biographical (BP, RAN) and other open-access databases. An analysis of book titles and connected meta-data should deliver a bottom-up reconstruction of trends and changes in thematization. Though many fields of history may profit from this experiment in digital history, the focus on religion will stimulate innovations in this subdiscipline.
