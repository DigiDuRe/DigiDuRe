# DigiDuRe
This repository contains code and scripts developed for the [Digital Dutch Religion Portal 1500-2000 project](https://research-software-directory.org/projects/digidure).

The project aims to map long-term developments in Dutch public discourse, especially in religion. It will link the national bibliography ([STCN](www.stcnl.nl) , [GGC](https://www.oclc.org/nl/ggc.html) over five centuries to biographical ([BP](www.biografischportaal.nl), Repertorium Academicum Neerlandicum (RAN ~ not availble yet) and other open-access databases. An analysis of book titles and connected meta-data should deliver a bottom-up reconstruction of trends and changes in thematization. Though many fields of history may profit from this experiment in digital history, the focus on religion will stimulate innovations in this subdiscipline.

## Activities within the project

Roughly the project can be divided in five core activities. 

1. The various datasources need to harmonized.
2. The data sources need to be linked, thus allowing it to be enriched.
3. Statistic and network analysis methods need to be explored steered by academic curiousty from the domain experts. 
4. Knowledge from the previous steps need to be disseminated with the project partners. 
5. The scripts and enriched datasets need to be stored in a sustainable manner allowing it to be reused.

Given the number of datasets that the projects aims to integrate, the steps above will most likely not be taken in a linear way. Instead, the actvitities will go in an iterative manner. Meaning that we first are going to link two datasets and perform a series of analysis(going through steps 1-3), followed by integrating another one and so forth. The methods that will be applied for the various steps will overlap.

### Datasets that are envisioned to be used in the project are

i.  [STCN](www.stcnl.nl)

ii. [GGC](https://www.oclc.org/nl/ggc.html)

iii.[BP](www.biografischportaal.nl)

iv. Repertorium Academicum Neerlandicum (not available in the public domain yet)


Furthermore, it is envisioned that a link will be made with [Dutch Historical Dictionaries](https://ivdnt.org/woordenboeken/historische-woordenboeken/#historical-dictionaries)

In addition, a link with the [churches database 1800-1970] (https://geoplaza.vu.nl/cms/projectportfolio/kerkenkaart-2/) and the [monastries](https://geoplaza.vu.nl/cms/projectportfolio/kloosterkaart/) database is likely to be made.


### Database design

The first step for the data harmonization is to generate a database design for the various datasets listed above in order to see where what can be connected.
