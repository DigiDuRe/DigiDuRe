# DigiDuRe
This repository contains code and scripts developed for the [Digital Dutch Religion Portal 1500-2000 project](https://research-software-directory.org/projects/digidure).

The project aims to map long-term developments in Dutch public discourse, especially in religion. To do so, it will link the Short-Title Catalogue Netherlands ([STCN]( http://data.bibliotheken.nl/doc/dataset/stcn)) dataset, the Gemeenschappelijk Geautomatiseerde Catalogiseersysteem ([GGC](https://www.oclc.org/nl/ggc.html)), the Dutch Biography Portal ([BP](http://www.biografischportaal.nl/)), the Repertorium Academicum Neerlandicum (RAN ~ not available in the public domain) and various other open-access databases. 
Through a connection between the various datasets an analysis of book titles and connected meta-data can be performed which is anticipated to deliver a bottom-up reconstruction of trends and changes in thematization. Though many fields of history may profit from this experiment in digital history, the focus on religion will stimulate innovations in this subdiscipline.

## Overview of activities within the project

Roughly the project can be divided in five core activities. 

1. The various data sources need to harmonized. It must become clear how the various datasets can be connected and what possible conversions need to be made in order to do so. As a first step we therefore aim to map the various database schemas that we want to connect. 
2. Once the database schemas are clear, the technical steps need to be taken to actually link the various datasets in order for them to be linked and enriched.
3. The moment the datasets are linked/connected, a series of analysis methods can be performed. Queries combined with statistic and or network analysis methods will be applied to identify relevant connections in the datasets. 
4. As a fourth step, the knowledge from the previous steps will be disseminated allowing these to be reproduced by other scholars. 
5. Finally, all the scripts for harmonization and analyses need to be stored in a sustainable manner allowing it to be reused.

Given the number of datasets that the projects aims to integrate, the steps above will not be taken in a linear way. Instead, the activities will be performed in an iterative manner. Meaning that we are first going to link two datasets and perform a series of analyses (going through steps 1-3), followed by integrating another dataset and later on another one etc. . 
### Datasets that are envisioned to be used in the project are

i.  Short-Title Catalogue Netherlands [STCN](http://data.bibliotheken.nl/doc/dataset/stcn)

ii. Gemeenschappelijk Geautomatiseerde Catalogiseersysteem [GGC](https://www.oclc.org/nl/ggc.html)

iii. the Dutch Biography Portal [BP](www.biografischportaal.nl/)

iv. Repertorium Academicum Neerlandicum (not available in the public domain)


Furthermore, we envision that a link will be made with [Dutch Historical Dictionaries](https://ivdnt.org/woordenboeken/historische-woordenboeken/#historical-dictionaries)

In addition, a link with the [churches database 1800-1970] (https://geoplaza.vu.nl/cms/projectportfolio/kerkenkaart-2/) and the [monastries](https://geoplaza.vu.nl/cms/projectportfolio/kloosterkaart/) database is likely to be made and will be explored.


### Database schemas 

The first step for the data harmonization is to generate a database schema for the various datasets listed above. This schema will allow us to see where what fields can be connected and based on what characteristics these datasets can be linked.
