# DigiDuRe
This repository contains code and scripts developed for the [Digital Dutch Religion Portal 1500-2000 project](https://research-software-directory.org/projects/digidure).

The project aims to map long-term developments in Dutch public discourse, especially in religion. It will link the national bibliography ([STCN](www.stcnl.nl) , [GGC](https://www.oclc.org/nl/ggc.html) over five centuries to biographical ([BP](www.biografischportaal.nl), Repertorium Academicum Neerlandicum (RAN ~ not availble yet) and other open-access databases. An analysis of book titles and connected meta-data should deliver a bottom-up reconstruction of trends and changes in thematization. Though many fields of history may profit from this experiment in digital history, the focus on religion will stimulate innovations in this subdiscipline.
